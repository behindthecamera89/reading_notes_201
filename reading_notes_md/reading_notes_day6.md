# **Problem Domain, Objects, and the DOM**
# [The Problem Domain is the hardest part of programming](https://simpleprogrammer.com/understanding-the-problem-domain-is-the-hardest-part-of-programming)
- writing code is like putting together a jigsaw puzzle
- problem domains clearly point out how the code should act and gives detailed instructiosn of what you want it to do
- almost like a script 
- understanding the problem that the code is trying to figure out makes writing code so much easeir 
- narrow your focus to parts of the problem domain
- understanding what needs to be done before writing the code can be very useful. It can save a lot of time and make you not have to rewrite code 

Chapter 3: “Object Literals” (pp.100-105)
- objects group together a set of variables and functions 
- objects can have properties 
- literal notation is the easiest and most popular way to create objects
- you can access an object using dot notation
- var hotelName = hotel-object.name-property method
- 

Chapter 5: “Document Object Model” (pp.183-242)
- This is called the DOM
- specifies how a browser should create a model of an HTML page
- Use a DOM tree
- the model of the DOM tree is made of objects
- You will here people call the DOM an API (Application Programming Interface)
- The Dom tree is a model of a webpage
- Cache Dom Queries - This is used if you need to work with an element more then once
- Methods are used to return nodes
- document.getElementBtId('one') use to seled a single element
- single elemtents using ID attributes
- whenver a Dom query can return more then one node it always returs a nodelist
- from the node you can access and update its contents 
- an element node can contain multiple text nodes and child elements 
- jquery helps older browsers implemt the DOM method
- browsers offer tools for viewing the DOM tree
